#### PocketSphinx Model

A prepared language model is included in the distribution.

##### Create a new Melissa language model

From the top level Melissa directory run

```python -m setup.create_lm```

##### Uncompress the PocketSphinx acoustic model.

This step is required for a new Melissa install.

From the top level Melissa directory cd to data/model/hmm and extract the PocketSphinx hmm files.

```tar -xjf en_US.bz2```

##### Notes

The ```hmm/en_US/hub4wsj_sc_8k``` file comes from the PocketSphinx download.

The [phrase_list.txt](https://github.com/neilnelson/Melissa-Core/blob/master/data/model/phrase_list.txt), [lm](https://github.com/neilnelson/Melissa-Core/blob/master/data/model/lm/sphinx.lm) and [dic](https://github.com/neilnelson/Melissa-Core/blob/master/data/model/lm/sphinx.dic) files were created using [create_lm.py](https://github.com/neilnelson/Melissa-Core/tree/master/setup/create_lm.py). Run the program from the Melissa-Core directory.

```python -m setup.create_lm```

A [user_queries.txt](https://github.com/neilnelson/Melissa_PocketSphinx/blob/master/user_queries.txt) file was manually assembled using the queries at [USAGE.md](https://github.com/Melissa-AI/Melissa-Web/blob/master/USAGE.md) and by adding lines a user might easily provide as alternates.

[create_lm.py](https://github.com/neilnelson/Melissa-Core/tree/master/setup/gen_lm_phrase_list.py) appends the words and word phrases (groups) from the action modules to the lines in user_queries.txt, creating a [phrase_list.txt](https://github.com/neilnelson/Melissa-Core/blob/master/data/model/phrase_list.txt) file.

The [phrase_list.txt](https://github.com/neilnelson/Melissa-Core/blob/master/data/model/phrase_list.txt) file may be manually uploaded to the [Sphinx Knowledge Base Tool](http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/tools/lmtool-new.html) page and the ```Compile Knowledge Base``` button clicked to obtain the language model files.
